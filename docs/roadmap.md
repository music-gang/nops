# Roadmap

What is done, what is in flight and what is left. It is written so that a
session that only has this repo (a cloud session, a phone request like "do
`config`") can pick a task and take it to a pull request without other context.
The working steps are in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#picking-up-work).

## How to read it

- A task is `todo` or `done`. **In flight is not written here**: it is a remote
  branch whose name ends with the task ID (`feat/config` works on `config`).
  `git ls-remote --heads origin` lists them.
- A task is startable when every task in *Depends on* is `done` and no branch
  for it exists.
- **Ready** says whether it can be done unattended. `yes`: go. `plan first`:
  design questions are still open, so lay out the plan and the questions to
  the maintainer in the session and wait for their answers — no branch, no PR
  for this step.
- The PR that finishes a task sets it to `done` here and adds the decisions it
  took to the [decision log](design/decisions.md). The *Notes* of the tasks that
  come next are updated with what was learned.
- To add a task: a new block with a unique lowercase-hyphen ID (it becomes a
  branch name), and the same fields as the others.

## Done

| Task | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `meta` | Parsing and validation of the `nops_*` meta keys | `internal/meta` |
| `store` | SQLite store, migrations, state machine transitions | `internal/store` |
| `nomadx` | Nomad client wrapper, CAS-only register | `internal/nomadx` |
| `ci-setup` | GitHub Actions, repo policies, license | #1, #2 |
| `hooks` | Hook runner: dispatch, wait, timeout, stop, recovery of a run | #3, `internal/hooks` |
| `vocabulary` | [Vocabulary](vocabulary.md) of the terms used everywhere | #4 |
| `pr-template` | No PR template: the description is the commit body | #5, #6 |
| `config` | Flags and `NOPS_*` env vars with validation ([configuration](configuration.md)) | #8, `internal/config` |
| `redact` | Secret values removed from the plan diff ([rules](dashboard.md#secret-redaction)) | #9, `internal/redact` |
| `notify` | Notifications through built-in adapters ([notifications](error-handling.md#notifications)) | `internal/notify` |
| `gitwatch` | In-memory git watcher ([design](design/gitwatch.md)), `-git-path` in `config` | #12, `internal/gitwatch` |
| `engine-detection` | Detection cycle: parse, plan, create/supersede/revalidate deployments, hook sync ([design](design/engine-detection.md)) | `internal/engine` |
| `engine-apply` | Apply loop: approve/reject, register, health, timeout, the anti-loop rule and blocked drift ([design](design/engine-apply.md)) | `internal/engine` |
| `engine-recovery` | Recovery after a restart: `RunApply`'s first cycle, crash-window tests, health fails on an outside edit ([design](design/engine-apply.md#decisions), 8) | #16, `internal/engine` |
| `web-auth` | OIDC login of the dashboard: allowlist, session, `Require`, cross-origin protection ([dashboard](dashboard.md#authentication)); `-auth-header` replaced by the `-oidc-*` options | `internal/web`, `internal/config` |
| `web` | Dashboard pages (pending, history, drift, deployment detail with an htmx-polled status fragment), diff renderer, git webhook per forge ([dashboard](dashboard.md)) | `internal/web`, `internal/config` |
| `local-auth` | A second login backend, local users (`-auth-mode=basic`, `username:bcrypt-hash` file), mutually exclusive with OIDC (`-auth-mode=oidc`) via a required `-auth-mode`; session/cookie/`Require`/logout shared between the two through `web.Authenticator` ([dashboard](dashboard.md#authentication)) | `internal/web`, `internal/config` |
| `wiring` | `cmd/nops`: builds every component, runs the three loops and the dashboard, shuts down cleanly on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`; a `run(ctx, cfg, log) error` factored out of `main` for the whole wiring to be one reviewable, testable unit ([binary smoke test](development.md#integration)) | `cmd/nops` |

## Todo

| Task | Depends on | Ready |
|---|---|---|
| [`acceptance`](#acceptance) | `wiring` | yes |

### acceptance

- **Read first:** [development.md](development.md#integration) (manual
  checklists for the real cluster).
- **Scope:** `docs/acceptance/`: one checklist per realistic scenario (heavy
  image pre-pull on a host volume, backup before a stateful deploy, approval
  flow). The README status note changes from "early development" to usable.
- **Done when:** the checklists exist and were run once against the real cluster.
